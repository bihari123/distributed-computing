In the industry, there are several standard practices that you should consider, namely:

- **Adding visible monitoring and logging**: Add monitoring and logging mechanisms to your system, and make them visible via specific platforms. For instance, many companies use third-party services (like Datadog) for monitoring their systems.
    
- **Building automation support**: It should be simple to quickly bootstrap the critical parts of your system so that in times of disaster, you can quickly respond.
    
- **Creating proper documentation**: New developers joining your team should be benefiting from the docs that you provide. Good documentation will help you build and scale a skilled developer team. Also, when things fail, developers should have proper docs at their disposal so that they can conduct the recovery procedure.
    
- **Implementing a self-healing mechanism**: If things go wrong, the system should try to fix the issue itself. This is very crucial to building a robust system. Achieving a self-healing mechanism can be hard but the outcome is worth it. Though this self-healing mechanism should allow developers to take control if required.
    
- **Minimizing surprises**: As an owner, you should list the stuff that might go wrong and create recovery processes for each. If you encounter new surprises, learn from them, document what you learned, and enhance the recovery mechanism. In time, this will help you minimize surprises in your system.
